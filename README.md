OSM Data Processing and Anomaly Detection for Map Routes

This project processes and normalizes geographic data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) files and includes an anomaly detection model for identifying irregularities in map routes. It extracts nodes and routes, performs normalization, and prepares the data for anomaly detection or further analysis.

## Features

- **OSM Data Parsing**: Extracts nodes (latitude and longitude) and ways (routes) from OSM XML files.
- **Data Normalization**: Normalizes geographic coordinates for machine learning tasks.
- **Sequence Padding**: Prepares routes as padded sequences.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Implements a model to detect irregularities in map routes.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Required libraries:
  - `xmltodict`
  - `numpy`
  - `tensorflow` (for padding sequences and building the anomaly detection model)

## Usage

1. Place your OSM file in the project directory.
2. Update the file path in the notebook:
   ```python
   osm_file = 'path_to_your_osm_file.osm'
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to process the data and detect anomalies in map routes.

## Outputs

- Extracted nodes and routes.
- Normalized and padded route data, ready for further analysis.
- Anomaly detection results highlighting irregular routes.

## Example

Here is an example output after running the notebook:
```
Extracted 12210 routes and 67696 nodes.
Detected anomalies in 5 out of 12210 routes.
```

## Future Work

- Enhance the anomaly detection model for improved accuracy.
- Provide visualizations for detected anomalies.
- Train and evaluate additional machine learning models using the prepared data.
- Provide command-line support for data processing and anomaly detection.

## Acknowledgments

- OpenStreetMap contributors for the data.
- TensorFlow for providing robust tools for sequence padding, normalization, and anomaly detection.
